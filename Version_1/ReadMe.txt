Where Version 1 of the IR Remote Transceiver is stored. This is primarily breadboard analysis and potential designs on KiCAD. Next version will review results and modify for better requirements.

Version 1 should fulfill the following requirements:
- Be able to recieve an IR Signal
- Be able to store an IR Signal, at least 16 different button values.
- Be able to transmit an IR Signal
- Run on a low voltage device, between 3V and 5V like a typical consumer device that runs on batteries

Further requirements will be added on future stages.
